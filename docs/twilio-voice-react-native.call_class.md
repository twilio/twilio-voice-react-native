## Call class

Provides access to information about a call, including the call parameters, and exposes functionality for a call such as disconnecting, muting, and holding.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Call extends EventEmitter 
```
<b>Extends:</b> EventEmitter

## Remarks

Note that the call information is fetched as soon as possible from the native layer, but there is no guarantee that all information is immediately available. Methods such as `Call.getFrom()` or `Call.getTo()` may return `undefined`<!-- -->.

As call events are received from the native layer, call information will propogate from the native layer to the JS layer and become available. Therefore, it is good practice to read information from the call after an event occurs, or as events occur.

- See the [Call.Event](./twilio-voice-react-native.call_namespace.event_enum.md) enum for events emitted by `Call` objects. - See the [Call interface](./twilio-voice-react-native.call_interface.md) for overloaded event listening methods. - See the [Call namespace](./twilio-voice-react-native.call_namespace.md) for types and enumerations used by this class.

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `Call` class.
