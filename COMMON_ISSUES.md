# Common Issues

* Running the example app on Android using `yarn run android` may fail if the emulator is still starting up. When this happens, you can re-run the app once the emulator is fully started.

* Running the example app on iOS using `yarn run ios` may fail if the target simulator is not running or a different simulator instance is already running. Usually, quiting the simulator and running `yarn run ios` again will fix the issue.

* Interacting with notifications on Android will not foreground the application.
