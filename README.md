# expo-twilio

Expo wrapper for twilio. This module was created from the expo-module tutorial and then the [twilio-voice-react-native](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-voice-react-native) library was added manually.
Firebase has been removed from this implementation because it is not needed for our usecase and was causing issues with our notifications.


# Expo references
This package uses autolinking, which is documented here [existing library expo module guide](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/existing-library/)


# Installation in managed Expo projects

For [managed](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.
