1.0.0-beta.1 (In Progress)
==========================

## Changes
- The integration testing app has been renamed/moved to `test/app` to avoid confusion as to the purpose of the app.

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where some types on the `Call` and `Voice` classes were being incorrectly exported. Types and references to `addEventListener` are instead now correctly exported as `addListener`.

1.0.0-preview.1 (September 1, 2022)
===================================

- This is the initial preview release of Twilio Voice React Native SDK. Please check out the [README](README.md) for more details.
